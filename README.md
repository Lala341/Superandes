# SupermarketSQL


This project seeks to be a Java example of persistence and shared access of large volumes of data in the context of the design, development and operation of transactional systems. It addresses both the methodological aspects of design and the technology of transactional and relational databases. Superandes is a project with a basic interface that searches for the management of transactional data from a supermarket in a transactional database.
